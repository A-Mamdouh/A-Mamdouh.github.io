                In 2014, I was curious about combinatorics and algorithms.
                I started reading about combinatorics as well as learning Python by reading the documentation.
                Today, I have a bachelor in computer science and am experienced in a variety of programming domains.
                I am also attending the artificial intelligence master at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t, Erlangen
