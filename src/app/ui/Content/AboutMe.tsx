            My journey into programming began in 2014 with a deep curiosity about combinatorics and algorithms.
            I started by exploring combinatorics while teaching myself Python through its documentation.
            Over the years, I earned a bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science and gained experience across various programming domains.
            I have since completed my master&apos;s in artificial intelligence at Friedrich-Alexander-Universit√§t Erlangen and
            now work as an ABAP developer at SAP Fioneer, where I apply my expertise to enterprise software solutions.
