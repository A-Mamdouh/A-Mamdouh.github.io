                In 2014, I was curious about combinatorics and algorithms.
                I started reading about combinatorics as well as well as learning Python by reading the documentation.
                Today, I have a bachelor in computer science, I am experienced in most common programming domains.
                I also study the artificial intelligence at Fredrich-Alexander-Universit√§t, Erlangen, Germany
